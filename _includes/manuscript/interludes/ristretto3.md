[Aaron De Lazzer][a] on Ristretto:

> "The ristretto shot of espresso is one of the most fiercely debated and favourite topics amongst the coffee cognoscenti.  It is the purists pour.  The cutting edge of espresso extraction, flying in the face of the “Big Gulp” coffee drinker like nothing else around.  

> In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.--Antoine de Saint-Exupery

> "Antoine would have drank ristretto shots.  

> "There is no where to hide with a straight unadulterated shot of espresso.  Even more (less?) so with a ristretto shot.  Any weakness in the blend or in the preparation of the coffee will be brought to light here.  Either the heavens open up and the angels sing after that first sip or....something significantly less.  Which is always such a disappointment knowing all the potential distilled into the dribble of coffee liquor that barely coats the bottom of your cup."
