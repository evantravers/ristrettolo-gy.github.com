## About This Book

> Learning about "for" loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw.--Bret Victor, [Learnable Programming][victor]

Programming languages are characterized by their syntax and their semantics. The syntax of a language defines its user interface; If you understand a language's syntax, you understand what it makes easy. The semantics of a language defines its capabilities; If you understand a language's semantics, you understand what it does well.

*CoffeeScript Ristretto* is first and foremost about a book about programming with functions, because its flexible and powerful functions are what make the [CoffeeScript] programming language so capable, and what CoffeeScript does well.

### how this book is organized

*CoffeeScript Ristretto* begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances in Chapter Five. Chapter Six, "[An Extra Shot of Ideas](#extra-shot)," introduces advanced CoffeeScript idioms like method decorators. Since *CoffeeScript Ristretto* is a book about CoffeeScript's semantics, each topic is covered thoroughly, without hand-waving or simplification.

As a result, *CoffeeScript Ristretto* is a rich, dense read, much like the Espresso Ristretto beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.
