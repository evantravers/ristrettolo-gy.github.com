## Foreword by Jeremy Ashkenas

> "I particularly enjoyed this small book because I've reached for it a hundred times before and come up empty-handed. Large and heavy manuals on object-oriented programming and JavaScript are all around us, but to find a book that tackles the fundamental features of functions and objects in a brief, strong gulp, is rare indeed.

> "With the inimitable Mr. Braithwaite as your guide, you'll explore the nature of functions, the nooks and crannies of lexical scope, the essence of reference, the method of mutation, the construction of classes, callbacks, prototypes, promises, and more. And you'll learn a great deal about the internals of CoffeeScript and the semantics of JavaScript along the way. Every feature is broken apart into its basic pieces, and you put it back together yourself, brick by brick.

> "This book is dense, but hopefully you've chosen it because you like your ristretto bold and strong. If Reg had pulled it any thicker you'd have to chew it."â€”Jeremy Ashkenas, CoffeeScript's creator
