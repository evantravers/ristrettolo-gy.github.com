## What Will You Learn?

Like *The Little Schemer*, *CoffeeScript Ristretto* is valuable to the new programmer as well as the experienced developer. *CoffeeScript Ristretto* will provide a deep grounding in the fundamentals such functions, values, references, closures, and functions that consume and return functions. It then progresses to advanced topics built on those fundamentals such as callbacks, combinators, method decorators, fluent APIs, and continuation-passing style.

### why you should read this book

The techniques presented in *CoffeeScript Ristretto* will make you a better CoffeeScript programmer *now*. You'll learn how to write cleaner code that takes advantage of CoffeeScript's excellent support for making functional programs that are easy for humans to read. You'll also learn the fundamentals that will make you a better programmer when working with other languages such as JavaScript, Python, or Clojure.

### suggested prerequisites

No previous knowledge of CoffeeScript is assumed, although some knowledge of common programming concepts such as values, functions, references, strings, maps, and arrays will be immensely helpful.

### current status

*CoffeeScript Ristretto* is in its early stages of composition. New material is being added several times a week, and existing material is being revised, clarified, and tightened up. If you buy today, you'll have an opportunity to help guide its progress through your feedback and to get a head start on programmers who wait for the final release.
