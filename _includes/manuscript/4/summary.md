## Summary

T> ### Objects, Mutation, and State
T>
T> * CoffeeScript permits reassignment/rebinding of variables.
T> * Arrays and Objects are mutable.
T> * References permit aliasing of reference types.
T> * The `letrec` pattern permits defining recursive or mutually dependent functions.
T> * "Normal Case" variables are automagically scoped.
T> * Comprehensions are convenient, but require care to avoid scoping bugs.
T> * State can be encapsulated/hidden with closures.
T> * Encapsulations can be aggregated with composition.
T> * Encapsulation resists extension.
T> * The automagic binding `this` facilitates sharing of functions.
T> * The fat arrow (`=>`) is syntactic sugar for binding `this`.
