### what we've learned about identities

Well, well well! We've learned that `is` tests for whether two things are identical, and we've learned that two numbers that have the same numerical magnitude are the same value. We've also learned that two strings that have the same sequence of characters are the same value, and it doesn't matter how you go about expressing them, in the end you will get the exact same value back.

The expression for this is that strings and numbers (as well as `true` and `false`, while we're at it) all have *canonical* representations. No matter how you end up with the number forty-two, it's the same 42. (Except the *string* `"42"`, which is not the same as the number `42`, just as the string `"true"` is not the same as the boolean value `true`.)

We've also learned that `not` turns everything into a boolean and that it has its own idea that `0` and the empty string are "truthy," therefore `not 0 is true` and `not '' is true`. And then I tried to trick you with `is not`, mostly because when I first learned CoffeeScript I made the mistake of writing `is not` when I should have written `isnt`. They mean pretty much the same thing in English, but not in CoffeeScript!
